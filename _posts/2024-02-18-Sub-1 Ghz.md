How to use the FCC DB to be able to obtain all kind of information on a specific Sub-1 Ghz wireless device/remote.

## Look for FCC ID on the device

1. Locate the FCC ID number of the device that you want to get information (it is usually on a sticker on the back)
2. Access the [FCC ID.io](https://fccid.io) website
3. Input the number and click on Search
4. On the device page, there will be all sort of information on the device.

## Interesting information

1. Proper name and manufacturer of the device
2. Image of the device
3. PDF (User manual, Technical information, schematic, etc.)
4. Frequency Range (Can be useful for duplicating the signal)
5. Application forms to FCC

## Duplicating the signal

This could be an interesting way to have more remote available for a specific device and make them part of a bigger home automation script. Also in case the remote get lost, broken or become discontinued.

1. Using a Sub-1 Ghz scanner
2. Set the same frequency that is listed on the page of the device

3. Another way to pinpoint the exact frequency is also by using the freqency analyser app

4. Once captured, the frequency can be rebroadcast and if the device controlled by the remote is responding, it mean that the frequency has been correctly duplicated.
