How to fix an Apple Watch Calendar not synching correctly with your other iCloud devices.

## Reset Sync Data on Apple Watch

If you're having problems with the calendar not syncing, you can use a setting inside the Watch app to reboot that connection. After enabling this feature, your Apple Watch's contacts and calendars will be erased and replaced with the most recent iCloud sync from your iPhone.

1. Open the **Watch app**.
2. Tap the **My Watch** tab.
3. Tap **General**.
4. Select **Reset**.
5. Tap **Reset Sync Data**.
